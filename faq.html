                    '                <p class="faq-body">Resonance Trade is a one-way, Bitcoin to Vollar conversion channel designed into VDS. BTC and VDS utilize the same elliptic curve algorithm so that they share the same private key. The key is passed through base58check code to allow the BTC and VDS public keys to be different. After a Bitcoin to Vollar conversion, the Vollar is sent to a public key under that same private key that started the conversion. So before any Resonance Trades can be made you must first get your hands on a Bitcoin private key.</p>\n' +

                    '                <p class="faq-body">You can imagine the Resonance V-Pool as an inverted triangle. There are 10 Vollar in the lowest conversion level and the Bitcoin to Vollar conversion ratio is 1:1. At level two there are 20 Vollar, and the Bitcoin to Vollar ratio is 1:2, and so it continues on for an infinite number of levels. The amount of Vollar in the Resonance V-Pool determines the level at the current time, and the current level determines the current exchange ratio. You can use the VDS app to check the current V-Pool level and conversion ratio.</p>\n' +

                    '                <p class="faq-body">ICEX and CEX are two phases of Resonance Trade. Resonance Trade is initiated at the launch of the project. ICEX is the high multiplier conversion phase that lasts for 3 block weeks (blocks 0-30,239) with reward multipliers of 5, 3, and 1.5 in each week. CEX is the regular conversion phase (blocks 30,240- infinity).</p>\n' +

                    '                <p class="faq-title">Why participate in Resonance Trade?</p>\n' +
                    '                <p class="faq-body">Resonance Trades multiply your currency. The conversion ratio in the Resonance V-Pool is not controlled by the market rate, but instead it is pre-programmed to get cheaper and cheaper as more Vollar flows in. This develops a type of arbitrage that users can take advantage of to make money. As more and more Vollar flows in, the Vollar gets cheaper and cheaper compared to Bitcoin. However, as mentioned above this exchange rate has nothing to do with the market rate, or rates of any other currency (fiat or crypto). Therefore, when the market rate is above the rate provided by the V-Pool, you can buy Vollar cheap from the V-Pool, sell it at the market rate, and claim a tidy profit. Additionally, this can also be a bridge used to help you anonymously swap Bitcoin for other currencies.</p>\n' +
